# Python-Game-of-life

> Conway's Game of Life in Python

Rules:
- in an empty cell next to which there are three living neighbors, life is born
- if a living cell has two or three neighbors, then this cell continues to live;
    otherwise, if there are more than 3 or less than 2 neighbors, then the cell
    dies
